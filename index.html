                    <p>
                        Everybody knows that keeping your finances in check is important, but knowing the importance and
                        understanding how to actually stay financially stable are two very different things.
                        Without financial stability, you could end up jobless, homeless, and hopeless.  Even people like

						<h3>Tracking Expenses</h3>
						<p>
                            When staying orgainzed, keeping track of where the money goes is extremely important.  
                            One way to accomplish this is by holding on to a record of your purchases whether they be 
                            physical or digital.  Update a balance book or excel sheet whenever you spend with a credit card 
                            to make sure you don't accidentally go into debt.  Staying on track of expenses helps protect you 
                            from overspending, fraudulent spending, poor purchasing decisions, and many more.

						<h3>Utilizing Net Income</h3>
						<p>
                            Being financially organized helps determine whether your life choices are giving you a profit 
                            as well as an idea of how much profit.  Understanding how much one makes through their job 
                            doesn't mean anything without a firm grasp over how much is left after subracting expenses, taxes, 
                            food and other routine costs.  The net income is what dictates how much money can be spent on luxuries, 
                            investments and other non-essential costs that do not involve survival as well as how extravagant 
                            someone can be.

						<h3>Keeping Emergency Funds</h3>
						<p>
                            Although organization can deal with most predictable cases, preparing for the unplanned is equally essential.   
                            In the case of car accidents, natural disasters, hospital visits, and other surprise events that occur during 
                            peoples' lives, emergency funds are necessary to deal with the financial cost.  Simply having some extra 
                            unused/uninvested funds covers you in the event of an unexpected financial blow, and can help prevent you from 
                            going into debt and provide some peace of mind.

                    <h2>Investing Tips</h2>
                    <p>
                        After becoming organized, the question stands "What do I do with my extra unassigned money?" To that, the answer 
                        is to invest in stocks.  This might sound scary to someone without any knowledge in stock trading, but anyone and 
                        everyone can get into stocks, especially with the current number of investing apps and companies followed by numerous 
                        sources of investment advice readily available in the internet today.  Stock trading isn't as hard or dangerous as 
                        it once was decades ago and it sure beats leaving that hard earned money to collect dust in a bank account.  When 
                        investing, there are only a few simple tips to follow: do research on how current events affect the market, buy with 
                        the mentality that you are becoming a part owner of that business, plan ahead and come up with reasons why a company should
                        or shouldn't be bought or sold, and be calm and patient with investments.  Research allows for the greatest opportunity for
                        net profit compared to buying randomly.  When treating yourself as part owner of a business, it holds accountability towards
                        yourself as an investor and pushes yourself to understand the company at a deeper level.  Creating reasons for particular 
                        investments removes the idea of impulse buying and selling giving your decisions a much less margin of error.  
                        Staying calm and patient also helps avoid making decisions based on emotion as there are times when the price fluxuates 
                        and while the sight of a random large drop might strike fear, it is normally followed with its share of large rises.  
                        Investing might not seem like an important or essential part of being financially stable, but it's benefits are subtle 
                        and life-changing.
